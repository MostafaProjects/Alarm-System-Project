This project involves creating an alarm system using the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, programmed in C. Interrupt handling and other system functionalities were carefully programmed to ensure smooth operation, with real-time response to sensor triggers and user input. The alarm system integrates with various hardware components, including a display screen, noise beeper, keypad, LED lights, and a sensor, all attached to the microcontroller and circuit board. The system is designed to allow users to activate or deactivate the alarm by entering a password via the keypad. When the system is activated, the sensor detects movement, triggering the alarm to sound for a few seconds. The system also provides visual feedback through LEDs: a red LED indicates that the alarm is deactivated, while a green LED shows that the alarm is activated.
